## Zomato Ratings at different locations
### Question 
##### Is there any difference between the ratings of one of the finest restaurants, which is in different locations? 
### Introduction
##### To find this, i'm using zomato app. I web scraped  AB's absolute barbecue restaurant ratings in 5 locations. Collected data and visualized observations.
### Libraries Required
##### 1.BeautifulSoup
##### 2.Pandas
##### 3.Requests
##### 4.Matplotlib
##### 5.Seaborn
### Procedure
##### Web Scraping a Zomato Website https://www.zomato.com by sending html requests.
##### Pickling and Loading data.
##### Finding rating in each location
##### Loading data into a table using pandas
##### Visualizing the results using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
### Conculsion
##### In this presentation I have explored Zomato site and wanted to select one of the restaurant from the top finest restaurants and compare the ratings in different locations
##### From the graph we observe that, the locations considered having ratings above 4 and below 5. The difference in the ratings ranges between 0.1 to 0.3. Ratings may not be the same at all the time but they have very small variation.
##### Therefore, we conclude that, a restaurant ratings may or may not be equal, even if they are not equal, they slightly differs in all locations.
