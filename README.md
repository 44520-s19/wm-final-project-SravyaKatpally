### Libraries Required
##### 1. BeautifulSoup
##### 2. Pandas
##### 3. Requests
##### 4. Matplotlib
##### 5. Seaborn
### Procedure
##### 1. Web Scraping a Zomato Website https://www.zomato.com by sending html requests.
##### 2. Pickling and Loading data.
##### 3. Finding rating in each location
##### 4. Loading data into a table using pandas
##### 5. Visualizing the results using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
### Conculsion
##### In this presentation I have explored Zomato site and wanted to select one of the restaurant from the top finest restaurants and compare the ratings in different locations
##### From the graph we observe that, the locations considered having ratings above 4 and below 5. The difference in the ratings ranges between 0.1 to 0.3. Ratings may not be the same at all the time but they have very small variation.
##### Therefore, we conclude that, a restaurant ratings may or may not be equal, even if they are not equal, they slightly differs in all locations.
